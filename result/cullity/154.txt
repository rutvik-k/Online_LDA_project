with a suitable binder or any specimen in polycrystalline form. The
method is thus eminently suited for metallurgical work, since single crystals are not always available to the metallurgist and such materials as
polycrystalline wire, sheet, rod, etc.,

may

be examined nondestructively

without any special preparation.
There are three main powder methods in use, differentiated by the

(1) Debye-Scherrer method. The film is placed on the surface of a cylinder and the specimen on the axis of the cylinder.
(2) Focusing method. The film, specimen, and x-ray source are all placed

on the surface of a cylinder.
(3)

Pinhole method.

The

film

is flat,

perpendicular to the incident x-ray

beam, and located at any convenient distance from the specimen.
In all these methods, the diffracted beams lie on the surfaces of cones
whose axes lie along the incident beam or its extension; each cone of rays
