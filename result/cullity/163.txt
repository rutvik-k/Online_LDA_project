as well as the total length of the film between the knife-edge shadows
and N. Because of variable film shrinkage, these films will generally have
unequal lengths. The length of one is taken as a standard, and a multiplying factor is found for each of the other films which will make its length
equal to the standard length. This factor is then applied to the U value
of each diffraction line. The corrected values of U are then plotted against
calculated values of 6 to obtain a calibration curve for the camera.
