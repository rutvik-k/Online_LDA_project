is obtained in a back-reflection camera of any kind, a Seemann-Bohlin
camera or a diffractometer as normally used. We have just seen how a
back-reflection pinhole photograph of a ground surface discloses the coldworked condition of a thin surface layer and gives no information whatever about the bulk of the material below that layer.
These circumstances naturally pose the following question: what is the

effective

depth of x-ray penetration?

This question has no precise answer because the intensity

of the

beam does not suddenly become

zero at

any one depth but

rather decreases exponentially with distance below the surface. However,
we can obtain an answer which, although not precise, is at least useful, in

the following way.
Equation (7-2) gives the integrated intensity diffracted by an infinitesimally thin layer located at a depth x below the
surface as
