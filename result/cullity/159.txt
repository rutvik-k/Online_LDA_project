Photographic film always shrinks slightly during processing and drying,
and this shrinkage effectively changes the camera radius. The film-shrinkage error may be allowed for by slipping the ends of the film under metal
knife-edges which cast a sharp shadow near each end of the film. In this
way, a standard distance is impressed on the film which will shrink in the

same proportion as the distance between a given

pair of diffraction lines.
