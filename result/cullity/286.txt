direction, as in Fig. 9-12).

diffracted rays in any one Debye cone is decreased
by absorption in the
specimen by an amount which depends on the angle 0, and when ft is not

zero the rays going to the left side of the film
undergo more absorption
than those going to the right. For this reason it is often advisable to make
measurements only on the right side of the film, particularly when ft is
large.
