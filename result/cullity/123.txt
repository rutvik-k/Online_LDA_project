4-5 Some useful relations.

In calculating structure factors by complex exponential functions, many particular relations occur often enough
to be worthwhile stating here.
They may be verified by means of Eq.

Consider now the base-centered cell discussed at the beginning of
this chapter and shown in Fig. 4-1 (a). It has two atoms of the same kind
per unit cell located at
