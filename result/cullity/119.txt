The three-dimensional analogue

[CHAP. 4

of Fig. 4-8.

These two waves may differ, not only in phase, jbut^also in amplitude if
B and the atonTstr-trre ongih"^l^^d^fferent kinds. In that case,
v .ie amplitudes of these waves are given, relative to the amplitude of the

atom

wave

scattered by a single electron, by the appropriate values of /, the
atomic scattering factor.
We now see that the problem of scattering from a unit cell resolves itself
into one of adding waves of different phase and amplitude in order to find
the resultant wave. Waves scattered by all the atoms of the unit cell,
including the one at the origin, must be added. The most convenient way
of carrying out this summation is by expressing each wave as & complex

exponential function.
