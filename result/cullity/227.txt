PA being the axis of zone .4, PB the axis of zone B, etc. We then measure

the angles between important poles (zone intersections and zone axes)
and try to identify the poles by comparison of these measured angles with
those calculated for cubic crystals (Table 2-3).

PB,
PA _ 5' an d pB 5' are all 90. This suggests that one or more of these
poles might be |100| or {110}, since the angle between two {100} poles
or between two jllOj poles is 90. Suppose we tentatively assume that

the distance between pole 6' and either pole 5' or PR is also 45. But
reference to a standard projection, such as Fig. 2-37, shows that there is
no important pole located midway on the great circle between {100},

assumed, tacitly, to be due to a 100 reflection. But aluminum is face-centered
cubic and we know that there is no 100 reflection from such a lattice, since hkl
must be unmixed for diffraction to occur. Actually, spot 5, if our assumption is
correct, is due to overlapping reflections from the (200), {400}, (600), etc., planes.
