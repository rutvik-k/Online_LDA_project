The

film intersects different diffracted

beams

at diJerent distances from the crystal, so elliptical spots of various
sizes are observed, as shown in Fig. 5-11. This is not a sketch of a Laue

pattern but an illustration of spot size and shape as a function of spot
position in one quadrant of the film. Note that the spots are all elliptical

with their minor axes aligned in a radial direction and that spots near the
center and edge of the pattern are thicker than those in intermediate positions, the latter being

formed by beams near their focal point. Spots
