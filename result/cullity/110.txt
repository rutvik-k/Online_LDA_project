tube, where x-rays are emitted because of the rapid deceleration of the
electrons striking the target.
Similarly, an electron which has been set
into oscillation by an x-ray beam is continuously accelerating and decelerating during its motion and therefore emits an electromagnetic, .wjave.
In this sense, an electron is said to scatter x-rays, the scattered beam being
simply ITie beam radiated by the electron under the action of the incident
beam. The scattered beam has the same wavelength and frequency as
the incident beam and is said to be coherent with it, since there is a definite

Although x-rays are scattered in all directions by an electron, the intensity of the scattered beam depends on the angle of scattering, in a way
which was first worked out by J. J. Thomson. He found that the intensity
