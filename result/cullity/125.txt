Thus, reflections will occur for such planes as (111), (200), and (220) but
not for the planes (100), (210), (112), etc.

The reader may have noticed in the previous examples that some of the
information given was not used in the calculations. In (a), for example,
the cell was said to contain only one atom, but the shape of the cell was
not specified; in (6) and (c), the cells were described as orthorhombic and
in (d) as cubic,

This illustrates the important point that

The

we have

derived in the above examples are

therefore of wider applicability than would at first appear and demonstrate
the close connection between the Bravais lattice of a substance and its

summarized in Table 4-1. These rules are
qualification, since some cells may contain more atoms
than the ones given in examples (a) through (d), and these atoms may be
in such positions that reflections normally present are now missing.
For
example, diamond has a face-centered cubic lattice, but it contains eight

These relations apply to a cell centered on the C face. If reflections are present
only when h and I are unmixed, or when k and I are unmixed, then the cell is centered on the B or A face, respectively.
