the only method that can be employed when a single crystal specimen is

not available, and this is the case more often than not in metallurgical
work. The method is especially suited for determining lattice parameters
with high precision and for the identification of phases, whetrier they occur

3-7 Diffraction under nonideal conditions.

Before going any further,
and consider with some care the derivation of the
Bragg law given in Sec. 3-2 in order to understand precisely under what
conditions it is strictly valid. In our derivation we assumed certain ideal
conditions, namely a perfect crystal and an incident beam composed of
perfectly parallel and strictly monochromatic radiation. These conditions
never actually exist, so we must determine the effect on diffraction of various kinds of departure from the ideal.
In particular, the way in which destructive interference is produced in
all directions except those of the diffracted beams is worth
considering in
some detail, both because it is fundamental to the theory of diffraction
and because it will lead us to a method for estimating the size of very small
