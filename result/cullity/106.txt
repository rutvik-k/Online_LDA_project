It does so precisely because the periodic arrangement of atoms causes
destructive interference of the scattered rays in all directions except those

predicted by the Bragg law, and in these directions constructive interference (reinforcement) occurs. It is not surprising, therefore, that measurable diffraction (scattering) occurs at non-Bragg angles whenever any
crystal imperfection results in the partial absence of one or more of the

necessary conditions for perfect destructive interference at these angles.
