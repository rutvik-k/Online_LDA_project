Note that these positions involve a common translation, which may be factored
out of the structure-factor equation.
4-6. In Sec. 4-9, in the part devoted to scattering when the incident and scattered beams make unequal angles witli the reflecting planes, it is stated that
"rays scattered by all other planes are in phase with the corresponding rays scat-

by the first plane." Prove this.
