is the method used to prevent the discharge actuated by the absorption of one quantum from continuing indefinitely. If the counter is filled

To avoid the necessity for a quenching circuit, counters have been designed
which are self-quenching by virtue of the gas mixture they contain. To
the main gas in the counter, usually argon or krypton, is added a small

proportion of "quench gas," which is either a polyatomic organic vapor,
such as alcohol, or a halogen, such as chlorine or bromine. As its name
