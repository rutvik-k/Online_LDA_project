the pattern is heavily weighted in terms of material just below the surface;
thus 95 percent of the recorded information applies to a depth of 0.001 in.,
but 50 percent of that information originates in the first 0.0002 in. (Note
that an effective penetration of 0.001 in. means that a surface layer only
one grain thick is effectively contributing to the diffraction pattern if the

specimen has an ASTM grain-size number of 8.)
