Unsymmetrical loading thus provides

for the film-shrinkage correction

without calibration of the camera or knowledge of any camera dimension.
The shapes of the diffraction lines in Fig. 6-5 should be noted. The lowangle lines are strongly curved because they are formed by cones of radiation which have a small apex angle 48. The same is true of the high-angle

although naturally they are curved in the opposite direction. Lines
are practically straight. This change
