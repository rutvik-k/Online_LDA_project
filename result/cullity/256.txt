Projection of the trace of a plane in a surface.

N

and S, represent the trace. Note that the diameter ACB does not
represent the trace; ACB represents a plane perpendicular to the plane of
polish which could have caused the observed trace, but so could the infrom

clined planes ADB, AFB, and AGB.
Evidently any number of planes
could have caused the observed trace, and all we can say with certainty is
that the pole of the composition plane lies somewhere on the diameter HK,

where

H and K are 90

from the trace direction

A ,B.

HK

is

called a trace

normal.

To

fix

the orientation of the composition plane requires additional infor-

mation which can be obtained by sectioning the twinned grain by another
