Suppose the orientation of a cubic crystal is to be determined. For such
crystals it is convenient to use the {111) planes as reflectors; there are
four sets of these and their reflecting power is usually high. First, the 26
value for the 111 reflection (or, if desired, the 222 reflection) is computed

from the known spacing of the {111} planes and the known wavelength of

holder is then fixed in this position, no further rotation about the diffractometer axis being required. Then, by rotation about the axis BB one
