7-5 Proportional counters. Proportional, Geiger, and scintillation
counters may be used to detect, not only x- and 7-radiation, but also
charged particles such as electrons or a-particles, and the design of the
counter and associated circuits depends to some extent on what is to be
detected. Here we are concerned only with counters for the detection of
x-rays of the wavelengths commonly employed in diffraction.
