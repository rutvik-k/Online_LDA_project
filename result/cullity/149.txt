In the examination of sheet specimens, it is frequently necessary to
obtain diffraction patterns from various points on the surface, and this
requires movement of the specimen, between exposures, in two directions
at right angles in the plane of the specimen surface, this surface being perThe mechanical stage from a

It is often necessary to know exactly where the incident x-ray beam
strikes the specimen, as, for example, when one wants to obtain a pattern

One method is to project a light beam through the collimator and observe
its point of incidence on the specimen with a mirror or prism held near the
collimator. An even simpler method is to push a stiff straight wire through
the collimator and observe where it touches the specimen with a small
mirror, of the kind used by dentists, fixed at an angle to the end of a rod.
