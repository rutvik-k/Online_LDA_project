the capacitor and resistor. When a is suddenly connected to c, the voltage
across the capacitor reaches its final value V not instantaneously but only
over a period of time, and at a rate which depends on the resistance R and
the capacitance C, as shown in Fig. 7-20(b). The product of R and C has
the dimensions of time (seconds, in fact, if R is in megohms and C in micro-

and it may be shown that the voltage across the capacitor reaches
63 percent of its final value in a time given by RC, known as the time
constant of the circuit. The time required to reach 99 percent of its final
value is 4.6RC.
Conversely, if the fully charged capacitor, bearing a
charge Q = CV, is suddenly shorted through the resistor by connecting
farads),

the charge does not immediately disappear but leaks away at a rate
dependent on the time constant. The charge drops to 37 percent of its
initial value in a time equal to RC and to 1 percent in a time equal to

complete ratemeter circuit consists of two parts. The first is a pulseamplifying and pulse-shaping portion which electronically converts the
counter pulses, which vary in amplitude and shape from counter to counter,
