Radiation with a great many wavelengths enters the counter when either
filter is in place, but every wavelength transmitted by one filter has the
same intensity as that transmitted by the other filter, except those wavelengths lying in the pass band, and these are transmitted quite unequally
by the two filters. Therefore, when the intensity measured with one filter
is subtracted from that measured with the other filter, the difference is
