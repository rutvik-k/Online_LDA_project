Cameras used with focusing monochromators (a) focusing cameras;
Debye-Scherrer and flat-film cameras
Only one diffracted beam is shown in
each case. (After A. (Juinier, X-ray Crystallographic Technology, Hilger and Watts,

monochromatic beam acting as a virtual source of divergent radiation.
In either case, the diffracted rays from the specimen are focused on the
film for all hkl reflections; the only requirement is that the film be located
on a circle passing through the specimen and the point F.

A

flat-film camera may also be used with a focusing
monochromator, if the incident-beam collimator is removed.
Figure
6-1 6(b) shows such an arrangement, where D is the specimen, E is a
Debye camera, and PP' is the position where a flat film may be placed.
In neither case, however, is the above-mentioned focusing requirement
satisfied, with the result that no more than one diffracted beam, corresponding to one particular hkl reflection, can be focused on the film at the

Debye-Scherrer or

same

time.

A

bent crystal may also be used in transmission as a focusing monochromator. It must be thin enough to transmit a large fraction of the
incident radiation arid have a set of reflecting planes at right angles to its

If radiation converging to
were incident on these planes and reflected at the points //, C, and (/,
the reflected radiation would converge to a perfect focus at F, all the
points mentioned being on a focusing circle of radius R centered at 0.
But the reflecting planes do not actually extend out of the crystal surface
