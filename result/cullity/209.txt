even though the counter and sealer are functioning perfectly.
Clearly, the accuracy of a rate measurement of this kind improves as the
time of counting is prolonged, and it is therefore important to know how
long to count in order to attain a specified degree of accuracy. The probable error* in a single count of

The probable error is that which is just as likely to be exceeded as not. Three
times the probable error is a somewhat more useful figure, as the probability that
this will be exceeded is only 0.04. Thus, if a single measurement gives 1000 counts,
