THE DIRECTIONS OF DIFFRACTED BEAMS

[CHAP. 3

These imperfections are generally slight compared to the over-all regularity
of the lattice, with the result that diffracted beams are confined to very
narrow angular ranges centered on the angles predicted by the Bragg law
for ideal conditions.

This relation between destructive interference and structural periodicity

can be further illustrated by a comparison of x-ray scattering by solids,

solids and liquids have structures characterized by an
lack of periodicity and a tendency to "order" only in the sense that the

atoms are fairly tightly packed together and show a statistical preference
for a particular interatomic distance; the result is an x-ray scattering curve
showing nothing more than one or two broad maxima. Finally, there are
