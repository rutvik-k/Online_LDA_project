Figures 7-2 and 7-3 illustrate two commercial instruments. Basically,
both adhere to the design principles described above, but they differ in
detail and in positioning: in the (General Electric unit, the diffract ometer
axis is vertical and the counter moves in a horizontal plane, whereas the
axis of the Xorelco unit

is

horizontal and the counter

moves

in a vertical

plane.

The way

Corresponding to these two kinds of measuring circuits, there are two
