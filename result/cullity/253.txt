conclude that the shape of a back-reflection spot is more directly related
to the nature of the lattice distortion than is the shape of a transmission

plane normal causes circular motion of the backward-reflected beam but

must not be supposed, however, that only radial streaking is possible on
transmission patterns. The direction of streaking depends on the orientation of the axis about which the reflecting planes are bent and if, for examreflection
