A continuous background line

intensity and the breadth K at half maximum intensity can be made.
Note that the integrated intensity is given by the shaded area, measured
above the background. A microphotorneter record of an actual pattern is

In very precise work, or when the line density exceeds a value of 1.0, it
is no longer safe to assume that the density is proportional to the x-ray
exposure Instead, each film should be calibrated by exposing a strip near
its edge to a constant-intensity x-ray beam for increasing amounts of time
so that a series of stepwise increasing exposures is obtained. The exact

relation

between density and x-ray exposure can then be determined ex-

perimentally.
