of the film is a measure of the inclination of the zone axis.
In Fig. 8 2 the film is \ie\\ed from the crystal. Coordinate axes are

up such that the incident beam proceed* along the z-axis in the direction Oz and the .r- and //-axes he in the plane of the film. The beam reflected by the plane shown strikes the film at S. The normal to this reflecting plane is (\\ and the plane itself is assumed to belong to a zone \\hose
axis lies in the //; -plane. If we imagine this plane to rotate about the zone
axis, it will pass through all the positions at which planes of this zone in an
set

actual crystal might lie. During this rotation, the plane normal would cut

the film in the straight line
is therefore the locus of plane normal intersections with the film and

The plane

the incident beam, plane normal, and diffracted beam are coplanar. Since

graphical method of doing this was devised by (Ireninger who developed a chart which, when placed on the film, gives directly the 7 and 5
