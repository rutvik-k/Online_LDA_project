in a thin surface layer (see Sees. 9-4 and 9-5).

The nature

of the changes produced in pinhole photographs

by progres-

sive reductions in specimen grain size is illustrated in Fig. 9-1. The governing effect here is the number of grains which take part in diffraction.

This number

is

in turn related to the cross-sectional area of the incident

depth of penetration (in back reflection) or the specimen
thickness (in transmission). When the grain size is quite coarse, as in
