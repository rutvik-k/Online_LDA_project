voltage of most counters is commonly found to lie in the range of 1000 to
1500 volts. It should be noted that some counters can be permanently
damaged if subjected, even for brief periods, to voltages high enough to

cause a continuous discharge.

There are several important differences between the action of a Geiger
counter and that of a proportional counter:

electrons so produced trigger other avalanches, and the net result is that
one tremendous avalanche of electrons hits the whole length of the anode

wire whenever an x-ray quantum is absorbed anywhere in the tube.
All these electrons hit the wire in less than a microsecond, but the slowly
moving positive ions require about 200 microseconds to reach the cathode.

This means that the electron avalanche in a Geiger counter leaves behind

of this ion sheath reduces the electric field between it and the wire below
the threshold value necessary to produce a Geiger pulse. Until this ion
sheath has moved far enough away from the wire, the counter is insensitive
