The second instrument has been aptly called a diffractometer: this is a term
of quite recent coinage but one which serves well to emphasize the par-

7-2 General features.

In a diffraction camera, the intensity of a

fracted beam is measured through the amount of blackening it produces
on a photographic film, a microphotometer measurement of the film being
