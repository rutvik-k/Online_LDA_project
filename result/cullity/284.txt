Table 2-3 shows that [uvw] must be [111], since the angle between (111)

values agree with the values of p given above within experimental error.
The fiber axis of drawn aluminum wire is therefore [111]. There is some
scatter of the [111] direction about the wire axis, however, inasmuch as
the reflections on the film are short arcs rather than sharp spots. If we
