lamps connected to the several stages are still on. As indicated in Fig.
7-19 for a scale-of-16 circuit, there is a neon lamp connected to each stage
~
and the number opposite each lamp is 2 n 1 where n is the number of the
stage. The initial pulse entering a stage turns the lamp on and the second

pulse turns

it off.
Since the second entering pulse causes a pulse to be
transmitted to the next stage, the lamp on that stage goes on at the same
time that the lamp on the preceding stage goes out. The integer a is
therefore given by the sum of the numbers opposite
lighted neon lamps.
