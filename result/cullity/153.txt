PROBLEMS
5-1. A transmission Laue pattern is made of an aluminum crystal with 40-kv
tungsten radiation. The film is 5 cm from the crystal. How close to the center
of the pattern can Laue spots be formed by reflecting planes of maximum spacing,

and those of next largest spacing, namely (200)?
transmission Laue pattern is made of an aluminum crystal with a specimen-to-film distance of 5 cm. The (111) planes of the crystal make an angle of
3 with the incident beam. What minimum tube voltage is required to produce a
