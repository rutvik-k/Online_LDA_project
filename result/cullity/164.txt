camera is, therefore, very useful in studying complex diffraction patterns,
whether they are due to a single phase or to a mixture of phases such as
occur in alloy systems.

For metallurgical work, this camera has the further advantage that a
massive polycrystalline specimen may be used as well as a powder. For
example, a metallographic specimen, mounted in the usual 1-in. diameter
bakelite mount for microscopic examination, can be fastened to the circumference of the camera and used directly. When a flat specimen placed
tangentially to the camera circle is substituted for a curved specimen, the
focusing action of the camera is slightly decreased but not objectionably
while the advantage of being able to examine the same area of the
specimen both with the microscope and with x-rays is obvious. It is
so,
