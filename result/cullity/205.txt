collision, forming neutral argon atoms and ionized chlorine molecules.

are of the

self-quenching variety.
The efficiency of a Geiger or proportional counter and its associated
circuits is given by the product of two efficiencies, that of quantum absorption and that of quantum detection. The absorption efficiency depends on the absorption coefficient and thickness of the counter window,
both of which should be as small as possible, and on the absorption coeffi-

and the length

cient of the counter gas

of the counter,

both of which should

be as large as possible. The detection efficiency of a Geiger counter, as we
have seen, depends on the counting rate and is effectively 100 percent at
low rates; with a proportional counter this efficiency is near 100 percent

x-ray wavelength, the kind of gas used, and its pressure, since these factors
determine the amount of radiation absorbed in a counter of given length.

Figure 7-17 shows how the amount absorbed depends on wavelength for
the two gases most often used in x-ray counters. Note that a kryptonfilled counter has high sensitivity for
