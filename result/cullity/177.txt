D, C, and K. Under these conditions the reflected rays from all parts of
the crystal do not converge to a perfect focus at F. Nevertheless there is
sufficient concentration of diffracted energy in a very narrow region near
F to make this device a quite efficient and usable monochromator. The

The use of a monochromator produces a change in the relative intensities
beams diffracted by the specimen. Equation (4-12), for example,
was derived for the completely unpolarized incident beam obtained from
the x-ray tube. Any beam diffracted by a crystal, however, becomes partially polarized by the diffraction process itself, which means that the
beam from a crystal monochromator is partially polarized before it reaches
the specimen. Under these circumstances, the usual polarization factor
2
(1 + cos 20)/2, which is included in Eq. (4-12), must be replaced by the
