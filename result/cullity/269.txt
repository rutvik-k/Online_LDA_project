from the spacing in adjoining regions. These regions cause the various
sharp diffraction lines indicated on the right of (c) by the dotted curves.
The sum of these sharp lines, each slightly displaced from the other, is the
broadened diffraction line shown by the full curve and, of course, the
broadened line is the only one experimentally observable. We can find a
relation between the broadening produced and the nonuniformity of the
strain
