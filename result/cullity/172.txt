It is sometimes possible to filter part of the fluorescent radiation from
the specimen by placing the proper filter over the film. For example, if
a steel specimen is examined with copper radiation, which is not generally
advisable, the situation may be improved by covering the film with aluminum foil, because aluminum has a greater absorption for the fluorescent
