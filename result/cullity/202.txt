The

effect of

counting rate on counting losses (schematic).

Since the resolving time of the ordinary Geiger counter is of the order
10~ 4 sec, counting-rate curves should be linear up to about 10,000 cps
(counts per second) if the arrival of quanta were periodic in time. How-

of

ever, counting losses are observed to begin at much lower rates, namely,
at a few hundred counts per second, as shown in Fig. 7-14. In the multichamber counter the counting rate is linear up to more than 1000 cps;
such a counter has a number of chambers side by side, each with its own

The particular counting rate where losses begin with a particular Geigercounter-scaler combination must be determined experimentally, and this
can be done as follows. Position the counter to receive a

(Cosmic rays, because of their high penetrating power, pass right through
the walls of the counter and continually produce a few counts per second.)
