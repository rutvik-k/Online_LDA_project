a typical diffractometer and shows the passage of a few selected

slits in

rays from source to counter.
Because of the focusing of the diffracted rays and the relatively large
radius of the diffractometer circle, about 15 cm in commercial instruments,

a diffractometer can resolve very closely spaced diffraction lines. Indicative of this is the fact that resolution of the Cu Ka doublet can be obtained
at 20 angles as low as about 40. Such resolution can only be achieved

with a correctly adjusted instrument, and it is necessary to so align the
component parts that the following conditions are satisfied for all diffraction angles

:

(1) line source,

specimen surface, and receiving-slit axis are

all parallel,

the diffractometer axis, and
(2) the specimen surface coincides with
