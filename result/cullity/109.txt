this case, there is another plane of atoms midway

However,
between the (001) planes, and the path difference DEF between rays 1'
and 3' is exactly half of ABC, or one half wavelength. Thus rays 1' and
3' are completely out of phase and annul each other.
Similarly, ray 4'
from the next plane down (not shown) annuls ray 2', and so on throughout
the crystal. There is no 001 reflection from the body-centered latticeTJ
