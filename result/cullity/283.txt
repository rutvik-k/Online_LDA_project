For this
reason, PUQV is called the reflection circle. If the grains of the wire had
completely random orientations, then (111) poles would lie at all positions
on the reflection circle, and the 111 reflection would consist of the complete Debye ring indicated in the drawing. But if the wire has a perfect
pole

then the diffraction pattern produced by a stationary

identical with that obtained

the axis [100],
this rotation, the (111) pole is confined to the small circle
PAQB, all points
of which make a constant angle p = 54.7 with the [100] direction N. Diffraction can

now

occur only when the (111) pole lies at the intersections
and the circle PAQB. These intersections are located

of the reflection circle

P

and Q, and the corresponding diffraction spots at /? and T, at an
azimuthal angle a from a vertical line through the center of the film. Two
other spots, not shown, are located in symmetrical positions on the lower
half of the film.
If the texture is not perfect, each of these
spots will

These angles are shown stereographically in Fig. 9-9, projected on a
